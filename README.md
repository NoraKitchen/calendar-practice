#calendar-practice

This project was originally set up as a place to practice with Angular UI Calendar/FullCalnedar jQuery plugin in preparation for using the plugin in ShiftWork Manager (https://github.com/JECII/Shift-manager).

My 'practice' got a little out of hand, and portions of what will later be code for ShiftWork Manager began to develop within the 'practice' code. This code will be moved eventually but till then, please see here for my most recent work on ShiftWork Manager.

This repository currently contains partially completed code for...

    1.  The Manager Dashboard - The view the manager will see upon logging in, allowing them to see the current schedule, alerts, and manage schedules and staff.
    2.  Edit/Create Shifts Comonent - Allows managers to indicate what shifts exist throught the week/day.
    3.  Edit/Create New Schedule Component - Allows managers to drag and drop staff onto a calendar to create or edit shifts.
